    <h1>Gazpacho</h1>
    <img src="./gazpacho" alt="Gazpacho">
    <h3>Gazpacho is one of Spain’s most famous dishes. Made using raw blended vegetables, it’s served chilled and perfect for a light healthy refreshing summer snack, canape, lunch or dinner.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 small onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 sweet red peppers, grilled & peeled (can be from a tin)</li>
        <li>200g strawberries or raspberries</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of wild rose vinegar (plus more to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>2 teabags chamomile tea</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the core from the tomatoes, peel the onion and garlic, and put these plus all remaining ingredients, except for the chamomile tea, into a blender. Blend to a smooth, even consistency.</li>
        <li>Pour the blended soup into a container, cut open the chamomile tea bags and stir the dried chamomile into the blend. Cover the gazpacho with a lid and put in the fridge for an hour.</li>
        <li>Once infused, pour the gazpacho through a fine strainer using a spoon to help move it through a little faster (but be sure to save the pulp as it’s perfect in a tomato sauce or vegetable stew).</li>
        <li>Taste the gazpacho to see if it needs a little more salt, or a splash more acidity from the wild rose vinegar. Once seasoned, place the gazpacho in the fridge until it’s time to eat.</li>
        <li>We love to serve this with a drizzle of good olive oil, black pepper, and chili flakes. It can also be served with diced cucumber or peeled boiled shrimp as a summer main course.</li>
    </ol>
